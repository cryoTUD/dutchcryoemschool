The aim of this school is to teach the basic principles and practical aspects of image processing to structural and molecular biologists wishing to determine macromolecular structures by cryoEM. The course will cover all aspects of cryoEM structure determination, ranging from sample preparation over data collection to processing and interpretation of high-resolution image data, for both single particle images and tomograms, and will be aimed at advanced PhD students and postdocs using cryoEM for structural analysis.  <p>Applications and registration</p> <p>Application:  The event is limited up to 20 participants. </p> <p>For selection purposes, please note that your application will not be considered without motivation.  </p> <p>During registration, please provide a brief motivation (max. 300 words) including a short description of your project, your level of prior experience with cryo-EM/ET and how you and your project will benefit from this school. You will also need to provide the name of your PI. Selected participants will be informed approximately 1-2 weeks after the application deadline on 01 April 2026.  </p> <p>Registrations fees:  There are no registration fees for participants from academia. The program includes lunch/coffee on all course days, and the course dinner on Wednesday 05 June. Transportation to and from the venues, and accommodation, are not included in the school and need to be arranged by the participants.</p>"},{"location":"#sponsored-by","title":"Sponsored by","text":""},{"location":"program/","title":"Program","text":"Monday 29-06Tuesday 30-06Wednesday 01-07Thursday 02-07Friday 03-07Saturday 04-07 When Who What Where 09:45-10:00 Tzviya, Ludo, Arjen Welcome UL, Gorlaeus EM 1.09 10:00-11:00 ?J\u00fcrgen Plitzko?
