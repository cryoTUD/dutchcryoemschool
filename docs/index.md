### Overview

<div style="text-align: justify">
The Dutch Cryo-EM School will take place from 03 to 08 June 2024 in Leiden and Delft. The aim of this school is to teach the basic principles and practical aspects of image processing to structural and molecular biologists wishing to determine macromolecular structures by cryoEM. The course will cover all aspects of cryoEM structure determination, ranging from sample preparation over data collection to processing and interpretation of high-resolution image data, for both single particle images and tomograms, and will be aimed at advanced PhD students and postdocs using cryoEM for structural analysis.
